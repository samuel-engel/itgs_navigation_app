# iOS navigation app
Helps students to orient around the school campus through an iOS application.

Until now, students had to rely on talking to other people, not always possible due to language limitations, and it took a long time to become familiar with the schoolâ€™s layout. I wanted to introduce a new system that would help students locate themselves in the school environment with the help of modern technology.
