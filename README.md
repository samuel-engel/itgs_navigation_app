# iOS navigation app
Helps students to orient around the school campus through an iOS application.

Until now, students had to rely on talking to other people, not always possible due to language limitations, and it took a long time to become familiar with the school’s layout. I wanted to introduce a new system that would help students locate themselves in the school environment with the help of modern technology.

* Provide an easy way to locate yourself around the different parts of the ISHR campus
* Include user-friendly and minimalistic GUI
* Provide only the most relevant information about each section of the school
* Display the layout of the school campus in a simple manner
* Compatible with the school provided iPads

The application features a fullscreen integrated map layout of the school with comprehensive annotations showing all important locations. Each annotation for every mark contains a title and brief information about its location. Additionally, there is a possibility to click the info button and reveal an alert message with a more detailed description of the location.

## Precise location tracking

The user can see their own location as detected by the iPad in relation to the school’s building which makes it easy to orient around the different buildings. The location tracking is very accurate which makes it reliable to use for locating the destination.

## Choice between different map modes

The user has the ability to use the default home view which displays the basic layout provided by the apple maps. This forms the basis for navigation around the school. There is also the possibility to switch to a satellite view to see the real-life view of the school campus and help the user locate themselves in relation to real-world view.

## Sidebar with all locations

The side menu displays all the locations conveniently sorted to have a better overview of what the school offers.
